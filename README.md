# CDH Command Line Workshop Resources

This is a set of useful links you might want to have access to. If you have git on the commandline then
you can make a local copy of this repo at:

```
git clone https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/commandline-workshop.git
```
You can also see my notes on bash and command line tools here:
